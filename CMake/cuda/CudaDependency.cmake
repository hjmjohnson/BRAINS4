# So we want to try and include the dependency file if it exists.  If
# it doesn't exist then we need to create an empty one, so we can
# include it.

# If it does exist, then we need to check to see if all the files it
# depends on exist.  If they don't then we should clear the dependency
# file and regenerate it later.  This covers the case where a header
# file has disappeared or moved.

  # for make files except for IDEs (see below).  The INCLUDE puts a
  # dependency that will force CMake to rerun and bring in the new info
  # when it changes.  DO NOT REMOVE THIS (as I did and spent a few hours
  # figuring out why it didn't work.
