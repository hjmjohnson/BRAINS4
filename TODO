Future Work:
	Add new AIR 5.03 Options to the BRAINS AIR dialog Box
    Work on the BRAINS Tissue Classification wizard
    Make all print statements currently used to be only turned on via ipl_debug calls to test level
    Fix invalid surface file write to return appropriate values
    Add data types to the Load Image Open dialog box
    Add Undo option for tracing. May implement via delta file.
    Do not allow multiple objects with the same name - Save with a new name should update internal name
    Fix Save dialog box for images - PLane box does not always become active
    
    
    
    
    Port Worsley and Randomization
    Integrate AFNI and SPM
    Complete Neural Net port
    Create a BRAINS Worsley viewing mode
    Work on NURBS editor

GREG: Are goto's necessary in file b2transformLM.c?  There are wanings that cleanup: is not ever referenced.  Are there missing goto's?

ALL: We need to remove warnings from the code.  There are several places where error message should be printed, but never will because of incorrect logic.  I.E. from b1surfIPLfilter.c
       if ( fwrite ( &curvData[1], sizeof ( F32 ), 1, stdout ) < 0 )
        {
            /* fprintf(stderr, "Failed to write depth values.\n"); */
            return ( FAILURE );
        }
The if always evaluates to false because fwrite only returns unsigned values.
From Man Page:
size_t fwrite (const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *stream);

Approved to do as we have time.

for all *.c *.h files, includes should be in the following order:
1) local includes i.e.           #include "blah.h"
2) ipl non-local includes   i.e. #inlucde <iplstuff/iplstuff.h>
3) system includes i.e.          #include <stdio.h>
This is expose dependencies very quickly, and they will be easier to resolve.


4) Fix spelling of \breif to \brief
5) Implement common indenting of code, and enforce this with CVS.


mv header file gates to the first two lines of the file.  This just makes it easier to do checking with head -2

Move comments from *.c files to *.h files.  the *.h files are public and should define the public interface to the library.  One should be able to completely exctract the documentation with doxygen from the *.h files.

Come to a common concensus for a formatting scheme.  Use indent program to enforce the formatting scheme.
	Decide on .indent.pro file formatting.  i.e. decide on code formats.  Enforce with CVS with input and outputfilters.
	make file in ~/.indent.pro that contains the following line
	-nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -bl -bli0 -bls -ncdb -nce -cp1 -cs -hnl -i4 -ip4 -lp -pcs -npsl  -prs -sob
	Put CVS filter into action.

Make sure that function prototypes in headers are defined as extern.
	Any function prototype in a header should be defined extern.

	
Break bkiplIO.h up into separate header files.  Only the "generic section" should stay here.
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkiplIO.h should be broken up into:
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwBlob.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwHistogram.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwImage.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwLandmark.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwLoopMatcher.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwMask.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwPalette.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwROI.h
src/iplKernel/bkiplIO/bkrwSurface.h

HANS:(Low Priority) Make obCube, obSlice, obScanline and make Cube,Slice, and Scanline data structures in iplUtils.h
HANS: figure out how to move pvobModules.h and obModules.h to iplObject/obModules directories.
==========================================================================================================
Posssibly move qhull from bkHull to iplFreeware

Improve regression test
==========================================================================================================
Cast notes from building regression test.
In b2 create bounded-image, the resulting image
has b2 image min/max copied from the original image.
This is worked around by saving and reloading
the bounded image;  the analyze filter recomputes it.

When scaling an image that is all one value, make
sure we don't ask IEEE floating point to divide by
zero range, as this puts the SGI in the red processing zone.

==========================================================================================================

Make the load and save image dialog boxes contain more information which can be placed on the brains3 command line
	Data type, Plane
    
For saving objects in general the list may get too long to display in the window. Redesign this menu button

Add an undo option for the tracing of ROIs

Add the database functionality to saving of objects
